# Job Categories & Skill Taxonomy

To keep Merit clean, accurate, and trustworthy, every freelancer selects **core skill categories**—and that decision matters.

Your chosen skill defines:

* What jobs you can see
* What jobs you can bid on
* How you appear in MeritMatch rotation

This is not about claiming everything. It’s about **focusing on what you do best**.

## 🎯 Skill Selection Rules (Tier-Based)

To maintain platform quality, skill selection is **limited by tier**:

| Tier       | Core Skill Slots  |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| **Tier 1** | 1 core skill only |
| **Tier 2** | 2 core skills     |
| **Tier 3** | 2 core skills     |

This ensures each freelancer focuses on **deep work**, not scattered bidding.

## 🚫 Skill Category = Hard Filter

Your **core skill(s)** define what jobs you can see and bid on. Period.

* You **can’t view or apply** to jobs outside your core category
* The goal is not to limit potential—it’s to **ensure alignment and reduce spam**

> Think of it like professional lanes—you can switch, but not jump across traffic.

***

## 🧊 Editing Core Skills: 90-Day Lock

To protect trust and client expectations:

* You can **edit your core skill selection once every 90 days**
* This applies across all tiers
* Changes must be supported by:
  * New portfolio items
  * Skill test (future)
  * Optional peer validation (future)

Changing skills is a **serious step**, and the platform encourages thoughtful progression—not impulsive pivots.

## 📈 Expanding Expertise (Without Gaming the System)

Want to grow? Amazing. Here’s how you do it:

* Prove consistent delivery in your current skill
* Showcase new project work in other areas
* Submit an upskilling request when you're ready
* Unlock new skill paths through Tier 2/3 trust

Skill growth is part of Merit—but it’s based on **real-world history**, not checkbox chasing.

## 🧭 Why This Matters

* 🎯 Clients get clean, targeted proposals
* 🔍 Freelancers are matched with what they’re _actually_ good at
* 🧼 The platform stays efficient, relevant, and trusted

You're not locked in—you’re dialed in. Focus builds reputation. And reputation builds freedom.
