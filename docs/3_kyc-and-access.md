# Identity, Access, and Trust

Freelancers and clients on Merit come from all over the world — including places where the banking system is broken, platforms are biased, or payments are hard to receive.

We understand that.

And we’re building this platform so that **you’re not judged by your location, but by what you bring to the table**.  
Your talent. Your effort. Your word.

Let’s walk through how identity and access work on Merit — in the simplest, most welcoming way we can.

## 🤝 What KYC Means on Merit

Let’s talk about something that usually scares people off: **KYC**, short for *Know Your Customer*.

Most platforms make it feel like a test — long forms, blurry passport scans, and rejection just because of where you’re from.

At **Merit**, it’s different.  
KYC here isn’t a barrier — it’s a bridge.  
A tool that we only use **when absolutely necessary**, and **always with care**.

You'll only be asked to verify your identity (KYC) in rare cases, like:

- Withdrawing money as **local cash** (regular currency in your country)
- Participating in governance or decision-making features
- In rare cases, if local regulations absolutely require identity checks — especially for large or bank-linked transactions — we’ll let you know. But since Merit uses crypto (not traditional banks), we often find smart workarounds that avoid unnecessary KYC.

> 🧡 The goal of KYC on Merit is *trust*, not *exclusion*.  
> We’ll never let it become a tool that limits access to real opportunity.

## 🌍 Built with Inclusion in Mind

We know that:

- Some freelancers face **bias** based on their country of origin  
- Some users have **no access to a modern banking system**  
- Traditional platforms can feel unsafe or unwelcoming during KYC

That’s why Merit offers a **graceful, trust-first KYC path**, including:

- Optional KYC in early stages  
- Support for **crypto payouts** using self-custodial wallets  
- Suggestions for **trusted local exchanges** you can use in your region  
- A direct **support channel** for those who need help with access

We promise:  
KYC will **never** be used to deny access — only to unlock more trust-based features **when you're ready**.

## 💸 What If My Country’s Banking System is a Mess?

We get it — in many places, connecting to a local bank is a nightmare.

So here’s how you can still fully participate:

1. Use a crypto wallet (like MetaMask, Phantom, or similar)
2. Earn directly in tokens like **SOL** or supported stablecoins
3. Convert those tokens into local currency using exchanges like Binance, Luno, or trusted local options
4. Skip the KYC unless you really need to cash out in local cash

> ⚠️ If you ever feel stuck or don’t know what to do — reach out.  
> We’ll personally help you find a secure, region-specific solution.

## ✅ When KYC Might Be Needed

In the future, some features may require identity checks — but only in special situations:

- If you're handling **very large volumes** of transactions
- If you're joining platform governance (voting on policies, upgrades, etc.)
- If **local law** demands it (we’ll tell you when and why)

When that time comes, **you’ll be notified clearly**, and **guided respectfully**.  
No pressure. No hidden hoops.

## 🧡 Merit is Here to Help You, Not Police You

We believe that talent is everywhere — and access should be too.

If you're good at what you do, **you belong here**.

Merit is built to support you, include you, and help you grow — whether you're in Berlin or Bahawalpur, Nairobi or New York.

You're more than a document.  
You're a builder, a thinker, a doer.  
And this platform is being built for **you**.
