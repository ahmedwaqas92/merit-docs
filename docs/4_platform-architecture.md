## 🚀 How a Job Gets Done — Step by Step

### 1. A Client Posts a Job

- The client fills out a clear job request form.
- They describe what needs to be done, by when, and their budget.
- Before the job goes live, it’s checked by:
  - 🤖 Two AI models that scan for lowball offers or unclear instructions.
  - 👀 A human reviewer (if needed) for a second opinion.

> 💡 This makes sure jobs are fair, well-explained, and not exploitative.

Once approved, the job is published with a **tier tag** — so only eligible freelancers can apply.

---

### 2. Freelancers Apply

- Freelancers don’t need to bid low or undercut others.
- Instead, they submit a short application (240 characters or less) explaining **why they’re a good fit**.
- Their **Merit profile** shows off past work, ratings, and Jinnah badges (proof of reputation).

> ✨ You don’t need to race to the bottom — just be clear, honest, and confident in your work.

## 🧱 Why Tiers Exist (And Why They Matter)

### ⛰️ Jobs Have Tiers — To Keep Things Fair

Every job is labeled with a **Tier**:

- **Tier 1**: For newcomers and early-stage freelancers  
- **Tier 2**: For those with more experience  
- **Tier 3**: For the best of the best

Freelancers can **only apply to jobs in their own tier** — not above, not below.

> 🎯 This means you’re only competing with others at your level. No power imbalance, no pricing wars.

---

### 🌿 Flex Mode for Experienced Freelancers

Sometimes experienced freelancers want to take on small jobs for practice, creativity, or just to help out.

That’s allowed — but with limits:

- **Max 2 jobs per month** in a lower tier  
- Each job must be **under $150**  
- Designed to **support**, not dominate

> 🧠 It’s like a seasoned pro stepping in for a quick jam session — not to take over the stage.

## 🔐 Secure Escrow — Everyone’s Protected

When a job is accepted:

1. The client pays upfront into a **secure wallet** (escrow).  
2. The freelancer sees the money is locked and safe.  
3. The job gets done.  
4. Once both sides agree it’s complete — the money is released.

> 🛡️ If there’s a disagreement, the platform team or a neutral system helps resolve it.

No one loses out unfairly. Everyone is protected.

## 🏅 After the Job — You Both Earn Trust

When the job wraps up, freelancers earn **Solana tokens (SOL)** equivalent to the dollar value of the job, and if there are **no disputes**, both the client and freelancer receive a **Jinnah NFT** (trust badge).

- Jinnah NFTs cannot be purchased — you **earn** them.  
- They help unlock more platform features and respect from the community.  

> 🎖️ It's like earning a medal — not just for doing the job, but for doing it well and honestly.

## 🧠 The Tech Behind the Scenes

Merit runs on the **Solana blockchain**:

- Fast ⚡  
- Cheap 💸  
- Eco-friendly 🌱  

All payments, job completions, and badges are recorded on Solana for **transparency and trust**.

> 🧭 Not sure what Solana is? Don’t sweat it — we’ll break it down in plain language soon, no buzzwords, no lectures.
