# What Are Jinnah NFTs?

Think of **Jinnah NFTs** as **digital trust badges** you earn for doing honest, dispute-free work on Merit.

- They're not collectibles.
- They're not for sale.
- They're **proof that you showed up, did the job well, and treated others fairly**.

Just like a medal or certificate you might hang on your wall—except this one lives in your wallet, and it travels with you across the internet.

## 🛠️ How Do You Earn a Jinnah NFT?

You earn one every time you:

- Complete a job  
- Resolve it without any disputes  
- Get mutual confirmation from both sides  

Once that happens, *boom*—the NFT is minted and sent to your wallet. 🪄

Both the **freelancer and the client** get one. Because trust goes both ways.

## 💸 Does It Have Real Value?

Yes—Jinnah NFTs carry value because **you earned them**. They're not just for show.

- Each NFT reflects the size and success of the job it came from.  
- For example: A $500 job might result in a Jinnah NFT with **a value equivalent to 3–5%** of the job amount in trust weight.  
- This adds up over time—like XP in a game, but backed by real proof of work.

> 📌 Just a heads-up: These percentages are examples only. Actual values and mechanics will be finalized as the platform grows.

While you can't trade or sell your NFT, it’s more than a souvenir:

### Here’s what we’re working toward

- **Staking rewards**: In the future, you may be able to stake your Jinnah NFTs to unlock platform discounts or extra features.  
- **Local perks**: We’re exploring partnerships with real-world brands—so you could flash your badge and earn perks like coworking access, event invites, or small business discounts.  
- **Civic impact**: Think beyond Merit. One day, Jinnah NFTs could signal trust for remote visa programs, startup grants, or skill-based communities.

> These NFTs are your track record, your trust score, and your voice in the Merit network.
> And we’ll keep finding ways to make them matter—online and offline.

## 📌 What Does It *Do*?

A Jinnah NFT isn’t just shiny—it's useful:

- **Reputation:** It shows you’ve done solid work without disputes. A trust badge that speaks for itself.  
- **Community access:** Jinnah holders can join Merit’s inner community—connect with other verified users, collaborate, and grow together.  
- **Recognition, not restriction:** Your NFT boosts your visibility, but it doesn’t block others. Work is still open to everyone based on skill and tier.

> Jinnah NFTs don’t lock doors—they open conversations.

## 🤔 Can I Touch It? How Does It Look?

Jinnah NFTs are **digital only**—they live in your Solana wallet, not your sock drawer.  
But don’t worry—we’re designing them to **look beautiful** and uniquely yours:

- Each NFT has a distinct style based on the work you did.  
- Visual badges may evolve as you earn more (yes, like leveling up!).  
- One day? We might even offer physical badges or prints you can order—because trust deserves to be framed. 🖼️

## 🧭 Why Call It "Jinnah"?

Named after **Muhammad Ali Jinnah**, the founder of Pakistan and a leader who believed in unity, dignity, and merit.  
This badge is a tribute to those same values—earned, not bought.

You don’t need to be famous or wealthy to earn trust here. Just consistent, respectful, and honest.

---

## 🚫 Can I Trade or Sell It?

Nope. These NFTs are **non-transferable**.  
You earn them with your actions, and they stay linked to your wallet.

It’s like your driving record—if it was made of gold and people actually wanted to see it. 🏆
