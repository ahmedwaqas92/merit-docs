# Welcome to Merit

**Zero Borders. Pure Merit.**

Merit is a global freelancing platform designed for one purpose:

> To give everyone — no matter where they’re from — an equal chance to work, earn, and grow based purely on their skills and reliability.

---

## 🌍 Why Merit?

Most freelancing platforms are full of hidden rules:

- **Limited visibility** based on country
- **Feature restrictions** based on geography
- **Pricing wars** that favor the lowest bidder, not the most competent

Merit changes that.  
There are **no region-based limits**, no gatekeeping, and no shortcuts.

You move forward based on the **value you bring**, not where you're from.

---

## 🔐 How It Works

- **Clients post jobs** or service requests
- **Freelancers apply**, complete the job, and get paid via secure escrow
- When both sides are satisfied, they **earn a badge (NFT)** — proof of successful, dispute-free work
- These badges unlock access to community spaces and advanced platform features

---

## 🏅 Merit = Trust You Can See

You can't buy your way in.

You can't fake your way up.

Every badge is **earned** — by delivering great work and treating others fairly.

---

## 💬 Built for Real People

Whether you're a student from Nairobi, a designer in Buenos Aires, or an engineer in Karachi:

- Your voice matters
- Your work matters
- Your reputation is yours to build — and own

Merit is open.  
Merit is fair.  
Merit is yours.

**Let’s build the future of freelance — with no borders. Just merit.**
