# Identity, Access, and Trust

Freelancers and clients on Merit come from all over the world — including places where the banking system is broken, platforms are biased, or payments are hard to receive.

We understand that.

## 🤝 What KYC Means on Merit

KYC (Know Your Customer) is required only when:

- You're requesting certain privileges (like direct payouts in fiat)
- You're accessing features that require regulatory compliance (like fund custody or governance voting)

But unlike most platforms, KYC on Merit is designed to **empower you**, not block you.

## 🌍 Built with Inclusion in Mind

We know that:

- Some freelancers face **bias** based on their country of origin  
- Some users have **no access to a modern banking system**  
- Traditional platforms can feel unsafe or unwelcoming during KYC

That’s why Merit offers a **graceful, trust-first KYC path**, including:

- Optional KYC in early stages  
- Support for **crypto payouts** using self-custodial wallets  
- Suggestions for **trusted local exchanges** you can use in your region  
- A direct **support channel** for those who need help with access

## 💸 Don’t Have a Local Banking Option?

No problem.

You can:

1. Connect your crypto wallet (MetaMask, Phantom, etc.)
2. Earn directly in supported tokens
3. Use your **preferred local exchange** (like Binance, Luno, or others) to cash out
4. Still retain your earnings and reputation — KYC not required in most cases

If you're stuck or unsure, just **reach out to our team** — we will personally suggest secure workarounds for your country.

## ✅ When KYC Might Be Needed

Some parts of the platform may later require verified identity, especially if:

- You're handling large transaction volumes
- You’re participating in platform governance
- Local regulations require it

When that happens, you will be **notified clearly**, and we will guide you with **care and support** — not pressure.

## 🧡 Merit is Here to Help You, Not Police You

We believe that talent is everywhere — and access should be too.

Our goal is to make you feel **seen**, **heard**, and **respected** — no matter where you're from or how connected your local banking system is.

If you’re good at what you do, **you belong here** — and we’ll make sure you can participate fully.
