# MVP: What We're Building First

This page explains the very first version of the Merit platform ‚Äî also called the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). It‚Äôs the simplest working version of the idea, with just enough features to prove it works and helps real people use it.

***

## üéØ What Is the Goal?

To build a freelancing platform where people can work across borders, safely get paid, and earn recognition ‚Äî no matter where they come from.

In this first version, we want to make sure users can:

* Work with others and finish freelance jobs
* Use a system that holds money safely until the job is done
* Earn a special badge ‚Äî something we call a Jinnah NFT ‚Äî after finishing a job successfully.

    > ü•á _It‚Äôs like a medal you can‚Äôt lose, fake, or hang on your fridge. (We‚Äôll explain it properly soon.)_
* Join the community and unlock new privileges based on the work they‚Äôve done

&#x20;

> üí° **Powered by Solana**
>
> **The platform runs on the Solana network** ‚Äî it's fast, secure, and cheap to use.\
> ‚ö° _Never heard of Solana? Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî we‚Äôll explain it later without sounding like a crypto bro._

***

## üß± What Features Will Be in the First Version?

### 1. Signing Up and Profiles

* You can sign in using a crypto wallet (like MetaMask or Phantom)

    > üß† _If you‚Äôre new to crypto or don‚Äôt have a wallet ‚Äî no worries. You can sign up with your email, and we‚Äôll help set up a secure wallet for you behind the scenes._
* You get a profile with your skills, reviews, and past jobs

    > üîê _You can choose whether this is public or private ‚Äî and decide if it should be indexed by search engines. Your privacy is in your hands._

### 2. Finding and Posting Jobs

* Clients can post jobs or services they need
* Freelancers can offer services or apply to jobs
* When both agree, the payment is held in a secure wallet (escrow)
* Once the work is done and both confirm, the money is released

### 3. Payment Protection (Escrow)

* The platform holds the money safely until the job is marked complete
* If there's a problem, there‚Äôs a simple system to resolve it (in early stages, this may be handled by the team)
* If no complaint is raised in 48‚Äì72 hours, the money is sent automatically

### 4. Earning Reputation (Jinnah NFT Badges)

After a job is completed **without any disputes**, **both the freelancer & the client** earn a badge ‚Äî a Jinnah NFT.

> üì¶ _These badges cannot be bought ‚Äî only earned through successful cooperation._

They show how much verified work you‚Äôve done and how reliably you‚Äôve engaged with others.

You rise through levels based on your contributions over time. For example:

* **Tier 1**: $100 in completed contracts
* **Tier 2**: $500
* **Tier 3**: $1000+

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These levels are just examples. The actual badge tiers and thresholds will be finalized as the platform evolves.

The more badges you earn, the more platform features you unlock ‚Äî including trusted community spaces , job visibility boosts, and merit-based privileges.

### üèÖ Why Badges Matter

These badges are more than just digital tokens ‚Äî they are **proof that both the freelancer and the client acted in good faith**.

They are designed to:

* Reward smooth and honest transactions
* Encourage both sides to communicate clearly
* Build long-term trust across the platform

Whenever a job is finished successfully and **no one raises a dispute**, **both sides ‚Äî the freelancer and the client ‚Äî earn a badge**.

This rewards not just the work done, but also the clarity, respect, and good communication between both parties.

However, **if a dispute is raised and resolved by the platform team**, **no badge is given** ‚Äî even if the issue is later settled.

This helps make sure that:

* Clients post clear, honest job descriptions
* Freelancers deliver exactly what‚Äôs promised
* Both sides work together with mutual respect

***

### 5. Community Access Based on Merit

* Higher-level badge holders can join exclusive discussions
* You can post, comment, and vote in the community if you‚Äôve earned trust
* This helps reduce spam and gives real workers more voice

***

## ‚ùå What Will NOT Be Included Yet?

To keep things simple, the following features will come later:

* Adding money from bank cards or local currency
* Mobile apps
* Voting systems for community rules
* Support for multiple languages
* Complex bidding systems for projects

We‚Äôll build these step by step after the main version is stable.

## üìä What Success Looks Like

If this version is working well, we hope to see:

| What We Track             | Target Number      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Wallets connected         | 100+ users         |
| Freelance jobs completed  | 200+ jobs          |
| Complaints or disputes    | Less than 5%       |
| Badges earned             | 1 for every 2 jobs |
| Community members posting | 30+ people         |

## ‚úÖ Next Steps for the Team

* Finalize how job contracts will work
* Make the badge (NFT) system live
* Set up a way to deal with problems fairly
* Invite early users to test the platform
