# 🔄 MeritMatch: Smarter, Fairer Freelancer Visibility

In most platforms, visibility is a race—won by the fastest bidder, loudest region, or largest portfolio.  
At Merit, we believe visibility should be **earned**, **balanced**, and **shared**.

That’s why we’re building **MeritMatch**: a dynamic rotation system that ensures every freelancer gets seen—without flooding buyers or leaving honest talent behind.

---

## 🎯 What Is MeritMatch?

MeritMatch is how we decide **which freelancers are shown to clients and when**.

Instead of ranking everyone in a giant leaderboard, we **rotate exposure**—like a spotlight that moves fairly across the platform. But this spotlight isn’t random. It’s guided by **signals of trust, activity, and opportunity balance**.

---

## ⚙️ How Rotation Is Prioritized

Each freelancer has a **rotation priority score**. This score is updated often and shaped by:

| Factor | What It Means |
|--------|----------------|
| ✅ Verified skill match | You’re only shown for jobs you’re truly qualified to do |
| 🔁 Engagement level | The more meaningfully active you are, the more you show up in rotation |
| ⏳ Current workload | Already working on jobs? The system gently rotates attention to others temporarily |
| 🌍 Global opportunity balance | The platform ensures freelancers from all regions get fair exposure, even when some regions are more crowded |
| ⚡️ Responsiveness | Quick, respectful replies signal reliability—and we reward that |

---

## ⏳ Activity-Aware Presence Score

Freelancer visibility isn’t about being online—it’s about being **present**.

Our internal system watches for **genuine, meaningful activity** that contributes to the Merit community. We don’t disclose the full formula (to prevent gaming), but we’ll say this:

> If you're engaging—reading jobs, learning, applying thoughtfully, or responding to messages—you’re climbing.  
> If you’re idle, spamming, or automating—we see through it.

The system is built to reward effort, not noise.

## 🌍 Global Opportunity Balance (RDM)

Merit is for everyone—no matter where you’re from.

But we recognize that some regions naturally have **more freelancers in certain roles**. To ensure **everyone gets seen**, we use a system called the **Region Density Modifier (RDM)**.

RDM doesn’t penalize or block anyone.  
It simply ensures that talented freelancers in quieter regions also get a chance to shine.

### 📊 Example

| Region | Role | Freelancers | Jobs | RDM Effect |
|--------|------|-------------|------|------------|
| India | Python Dev | 9,000 | 500 | Normal rotation (0.97x) |
| Chile | UI Designer | 60 | 200 | Slight boost (1.1x) |
| Nigeria | Web3 PM | 45 | 120 | Boost (1.2x) |

Here’s how it works:

- The **modifier is small and gentle**—ranging only from ~0.9x to 1.2x  
- It’s based on **role saturation**, not country labels  
- It adjusts **exposure**, not access—you can still apply to everything you qualify for

> We don’t give special treatment.  
> We simply make sure good work doesn’t get lost in the noise.

## 🚫 Skill-Based Bidding Limits

To maintain job relevance and reduce proposal noise, freelancers can **only apply for jobs within their verified skillsets**.

You can expand your available skills by:

- Adding portfolios  
- Completing platform assessments  
- Earning community-based endorsements

This ensures that:

- Clients get relevant applicants  
- Freelancers focus on what they do best  
- The ecosystem stays sharp and clean

---

## 🎁 Diversity Badges for Clients

Clients play a role in fairness too.

When a client hires:

- A freelancer from an underrepresented region  
- A lower tier with fewer completed jobs  
- A skill pool with less exposure

They earn a **Diversity Jinnah Badge**.

Complete a “diversity circle” (e.g. 3+ hires from distinct backgrounds), and unlock:

- Platform fee discounts  
- Community reputation perks  
- Additional trust weight in Merit governance

> Inclusion isn’t just encouraged—it’s rewarded.

---

## 🌱 A Healthier Marketplace

MeritMatch isn’t about control.  
It’s about making opportunity **visible**, **inclusive**, and **trusted**—so freelancers feel seen, and clients discover talent that might’ve been overlooked.

This is what meritocracy looks like when it works for everyone.
