# Tiers & Progression System

Merit’s tier system is designed for **accountability, growth, and balance**.

Freelancers progress by consistently delivering good work and building trust—and can always regain their footing through supported re-entry systems.

## 🧱 Tier Breakdown

| Tier | Who It's For | Job Access | Traits |
|------|--------------|------------|--------|
| **Tier 1** | New freelancers or re-entering users | Tier 1 jobs only | Starter visibility, trust building |
| **Tier 2** | Proven contributors | Tier 2 jobs only | Reliable performers with Jinnah history |
| **Tier 3** | Trusted experts | Tier 3 jobs only | High-volume, high-trust professionals |

> Tier controls job visibility—not total reputation.  
> Jinnah NFTs are permanent, even if tier changes.

---

## 🚪 Flex Mode (Tier 2 & 3 Only)

Flex Mode allows Tier 2 and Tier 3 freelancers to take on Tier 1 jobs for practice, prototyping, or gentle platform re-entry.

- Max **2 jobs per 30 days**  
- Each job **≤ $150 in value**  
- Tier status unaffected  
- Intended for optional self-paced refreshers

> Perfect for seasoned freelancers looking to reset or recalibrate.

## 🧗 Tier Promotion Criteria

| Move To | Requirements |
|---------|--------------|
| **Tier 2** | 10 dispute-free jobs, total value ≥ **$1,500** |
| **Tier 3** | 5 dispute-free jobs, total value ≥ **$7,500**, strong trust indicators (Jinnah NFTs, review quality, responsiveness) |

Promotions are automatic once conditions are met.

## 📉 Tier Demotion Logic

Tier drops happen for two reasons—**inactivity** or **underperformance**—but the recovery paths are clear.

### 🔻 1. Underperformance Demotion

Triggered by:

- Repeated disputes  
- Poor delivery quality  
- Low ratings across multiple clients  
- Ongoing communication issues

**Effects:**

- Immediate loss of rotation visibility  
- Account placed into cooldown status  
- Reinstatement requires:
  - Completion of a **Course Correction Session** (via platform)  
  - 60-day cooldown period with clean performance

> Trust can always be rebuilt—but it must be earned.

---

### 🔻 2. Inactivity Demotion

Triggered by:

- 60+ days of no job activity, bidding, or platform presence

**Effects:**

- Tier drops by one level  
- Rotation visibility remains **unlocked**  
- Treated like a returning newcomer with full reactivation rights

---

## 🌴 Vacation Mode

Need a break? Life happens.

**Vacation Mode** pauses demotion clocks for up to **30 days**.

- No demotion for inactivity during this time  
- Rotation resumes as normal when you return  
- Intended for short breaks only  
- Must be activated manually

---

## 🗄️ Archive Mode (Extended Leave)

For longer breaks or sabbaticals:

- Stops all demotion and removes you from rotation  
- Job visibility suspended  
- Re-entry takes **30 days** to re-verify availability  
- Useful for travel, health, family, or deep work seasons

> We don’t penalize stepping away—we just build systems that let you step back in with intention.

---

## 🧭 Why All This Matters

- Tiers reflect momentum—not status  
- Flex Mode gives skilled users space to recalibrate  
- Demotions are temporary, clear, and fixable  
- Vacation and Archive modes respect your humanity

You’re not climbing a leaderboard—you’re shaping a reputation. And Merit is here to honor the work behind that.
