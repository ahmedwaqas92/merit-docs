# Moderation on Merit: Fair, Transparent, and Community-Led

Merit was built on trust—but even trust needs boundaries.

To keep the platform safe, fair, and free from bad actors, we’ve designed a **community-first moderation system** that’s built to protect freelancers, clients, and the values we all share.

This isn’t about policing. It’s about protecting space for good work and honest people.

## 📖 What Gets Flagged?

Here are examples of actions that may trigger moderation:

| Violation Type | Examples |
|----------------|----------|
| 💬 Communication Abuse | Insults, spam, harassment, ghosting |
| 🎯 Misaligned Bidding | Applying to jobs outside your verified skillset |
| 🧾 Dishonest Practices | Faking job delivery, inflating hours, duplicate accounts |
| 🚫 Discrimination | Bias based on region, gender, religion, background |
| 🏁 TOS Violations | Off-platform payments, scam offers, exploiting users |

## 📬 How Reporting Works

- Reports can be submitted by any user  
- All reports are reviewed by platform admins or trusted peer moderators  
- No immediate suspensions happen without review  
- Repeat false reporters may lose report privileges

---

## 🚦 The Strike System (For All Users)

We use a simple, progressive system for dealing with violations:

### 1. ⚠️ First Strike — Warning

A gentle notice when platform rules are bent (not broken).

- Usually issued for minor violations (spammy proposals, low-effort communication)
- No account penalty
- Reminder of community guidelines

### 2. ⏸️ Second Strike — Temporary Restriction

If the behavior continues:

- Limited ability to apply for or post jobs
- Short cooldown period (e.g. 72 hours)
- Account review for guidance and reset

### 3. 🚫 Third Strike — Temporary Suspension

For repeat or more serious violations:

- Full platform suspension
- Option to appeal
- Must complete **Reboarding Protocol** to return

### 4. 🔒 Final Action — Permanent Ban

For confirmed abuse, fraud, or serious breaches of trust:

- Full removal from Merit
- Wallet and job history flagged internally (but not publicly)

> All actions are recorded transparently and can be appealed.

## 🧿 Jinnah Trust Weight in Moderation

Users with a high number of earned Jinnah NFTs:

- Have their **reputation considered** before enforcement
- May be eligible for **peer mediation** or second-chance cooldowns
- Are encouraged to **mentor others** through community channels

We believe trust should matter. If you’ve earned it, we treat you accordingly.

## 🤝 Community Moderation (Future Phase)

As Merit grows, so will the power of its community.

Our long-term goal is to introduce **peer-led resolution councils**—where select, high-trust users can:

- Review disputes (with both sides anonymized)
- Offer mediated outcomes
- Flag or override low-quality reports

> Moderation becomes a public good—not a private committee.

## 💬 Moderation with Merit

Moderation on Merit is built on the same values as the platform itself:

- **Transparency**
- **Fairness**
- **Community accountability**
- **Respect**

We don’t moderate to silence. We moderate to protect the people who make Merit possible.

Let’s keep it kind. Let’s keep it honest. Let’s keep it Merit.
