# Welcome to Merit

**Zero Borders. Pure Merit.**

Merit is a global freelancing platform designed for one purpose:

> To give everyone — no matter where they’re from — an equal chance to work, earn, and grow based purely on their skills and reliability.

---

## 🌍 Why Merit?

Most freelancing platforms are full of hidden barriers:

- **Limited visibility** based on country
- **Unspoken bias** around names, accents, or regions
- **Pricing pressure** driven by where someone lives, not what they bring

This leads to real problems:

- Freelancers in lower-income countries get lowballed or ignored  
- Freelancers in higher-income countries get pushed out by unrealistic pricing  
- Great talent — from anywhere — gets buried by unfair filters

**Merit is built to fix this.**

We don’t punish you for where you’re from.  
We don’t reward you for where you’re from either.

We reward you for what you can do — how well you do it — and how you treat others while doing it.

On Merit, **there’s no edge in gaming geography.**  
Only one thing moves you forward: **real merit.**

## 🔐 How It Works

Clients post jobs or service requests — but not as a race to the lowest price.

Freelancers apply based on their experience tier, and rates reflect quality — not where someone is from.

All payments are held in secure escrow until the job is done and both sides agree it’s complete.

---

## 💵 No Price Wars. Just Fair Work

Our system avoids price wars by:

- Grouping freelancers into skill-based tiers
- Letting clients choose based on **value**, not just **cost**
- Ensuring freelancers never compete unfairly across economic gaps

This creates a **healthy, respectful environment** where:

- Great work is rewarded
- Lowballing isn’t needed
- Everyone — from clients to freelancers — wins through merit
